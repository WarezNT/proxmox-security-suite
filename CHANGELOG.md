# Changelog - Proxmox Security Suite

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-19

### Added
- Complete Proxmox Security Suite with comprehensive hardening and monitoring
- Automated installer (`install-security-suite.sh`) for one-click security setup
- Real-time security monitoring with alerting (`security-monitor.sh`)
- Interactive security hardening script (`security-hardening.sh`)
- Automated security update management (`security-updates.sh`)
- Basic and advanced security testing scripts (`security-test.sh`, `advanced-security-test.sh`)
- Unified management interface (`proxmox-security` command)

### Security Features
- Fail2Ban integration with Proxmox-specific filters
- Container-level firewall configurations
- SSH hardening with key-based authentication only
- Unattended security updates with email notifications
- Real-time intrusion detection and alerting
- Automated configuration backups before changes
- Log monitoring and analysis with Logwatch
- Network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection

### Infrastructure Components
- Proxmox VE virtualization platform
- Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) for reverse proxy functionality
- Tailscale VPN for secure management access
- Cloudflare integration for DNS and SSL/TLS
- iptables NAT rules for proper traffic routing
- Multi-level firewall protection (Proxmox + Container + iptables)

### Network Configuration
- Public IP: Configurable via setup (example: `YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/22`)
- Private Network: `10.10.0.0/24` for internal communication
- Tailscale VPN: Obtained during Tailscale setup for secure management
- NPM Container: `10.10.0.2/24` (Container ID: customizable, use your own ID)

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Detailed copilot instructions for AI assistance
- Troubleshooting guides and best practices
- Security testing protocols and expected results

## Security Model

### Access Control
- **Public Services**: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) - Open to internet via NPM
- **Management Access**: SSH (22), Proxmox GUI (8006) - Tailscale VPN only
- **NPM Administration**: Port 81 - Tailscale VPN only
- **Container Services**: Internal communication via private network

### Protection Layers
1. **Cloudflare**: DDoS protection, SSL termination, CDN
2. **Proxmox Firewall**: Host-level traffic filtering
3. **iptables NAT**: Port forwarding and traffic routing
4. **Container Firewalls**: Service-specific access control
5. **Fail2Ban**: Brute-force attack prevention
6. **Tailscale**: Encrypted VPN for management access

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Failed authentication attempt tracking
- Service availability monitoring
- System integrity checks
- Automated email notifications
- Comprehensive security reporting

## Installation Summary

### Quick Start
```bash
# Download and install complete security suite
sudo ./install-security-suite.sh

# Configure email settings
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
sudo nano /etc/logwatch/conf/logwatch.conf

# Start security monitoring
sudo systemctl start proxmox-security-monitor

# Verify installation
proxmox-security status
```

### Testing Protocol
```bash
# Internal testing
proxmox-security test basic

# External testing (from non-Tailscale VPS)
./advanced-security-test.sh YOUR_PUBLIC_IP yourdomain.com
```

### Expected Security Test Results
- Management ports (22, 8006, 81): FILTERED/CLOSED from external sources ✅
- Web services (80, 443): OPEN for public access ✅
- Tailscale management: Accessible only via VPN ✅

## Known Issues

### Resolved
- LXC network configuration corrected from /14 to /24 subnet
- Proxmox firewall rules properly configured for public services
- iptables NAT rules implemented for proper port forwarding
- DNS propagation issues resolved with Cloudflare proxy settings

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Integration with external SIEM systems
- Advanced threat detection with machine learning
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Automated security compliance reporting
- Geographic access restrictions
- Two-factor authentication for management access

### Configuration Recommendations
- Regular security audits (monthly)
- Backup validation testing (quarterly)
- Security policy reviews (bi-annually)
- Penetration testing (annually)
